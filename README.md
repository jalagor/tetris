# Tetris



## Getting Started
To run Tetris, fork and clone the repository. You will need NodeJS in order to run this app. 
If you have Homebrew installed you can run:

```
brew install node
```
You can also install NodeJS from:

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/ 
```

After that, open the directory you've cloned the frontend into and run:

```
npm start
```
This should open up a localhost server with the game. 

## Gameplay

Control the piece by pressing the left and right arrows on your keyboard.

This is a beta version of this game and there is work still being done.
